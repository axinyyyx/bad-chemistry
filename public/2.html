    <h1>Helium </h1>
    <hr/>

    <p class="intro"><strong>Helium</strong> is the second element in the periodic table and is classified as a noble gas. It is colorless, odorless, and the second lightest element after Hydrogen. Helium is an inert gas, meaning it doesn't easily react with other elements or compounds.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Facts About Helium</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, after Hydrogen.</li>
        <li>Helium is lighter than air and is commonly used to fill balloons and airships.</li>
        <li>It has the lowest boiling and melting points of any element.</li>
        <li>Helium does not solidify under standard pressure, even at absolute zero.</li>
        <li>The Sun produces Helium through the nuclear fusion of Hydrogen.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Helium</h2>
    <p>Helium was first discovered in 1868 by French astronomer <strong>Pierre Janssen</strong> and English scientist <strong>Norman Lockyer</strong>. It was identified in the Sun's spectrum during a solar eclipse before being found on Earth in 1895 by Sir William Ramsay while studying uranium minerals.</p>
    
    <h2>Uses of Helium</h2>
    <p>Helium has many unique and important applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cryogenics:</strong> Helium is used as a coolant for superconducting magnets in MRI scanners.</li>
        <li><strong>Space exploration:</strong> Helium is used to pressurize fuel tanks and in the cooling of rocket engines.</li>
        <li><strong>Breathing mixtures:</strong> Helium is combined with oxygen to create breathing gases for deep-sea diving.</li>
        <li><strong>Balloon inflation:</strong> Helium is widely used to fill decorative and weather balloons.</li>
    </ul>
