    <h2>Interesting Facts About Lithium</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lithium is the least dense metal and can float on water.</li>
        <li>It reacts vigorously with water, producing hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide.</li>
        <li>Lithium is used in the production of lightweight batteries, especially for portable electronics and electric vehicles.</li>
        <li>It is an essential component in treating certain mental health conditions, like bipolar disorder.</li>
        <li>Lithium does not occur freely in nature but is found in minerals such as spodumene and petalite.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Lithium</h2>
    <p>Lithium was discovered in 1817 by Swedish chemist <strong>Johan August Arfvedson</strong> while analyzing the mineral petalite. Its name comes from the Greek word "lithos," meaning stone, because it was first found in minerals rather than plant or animal matter.</p>
    
    <h2>Uses of Lithium</h2>
    <p>Lithium has numerous important applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Batteries:</strong> Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Glass and ceramics:</strong> Lithium is used to strengthen glass and ceramics.</li>
        <li><strong>Medicines:</strong> Lithium compounds are used to treat psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder.</li>
        <li><strong>Alloys:</strong> Lithium is used to create lightweight and strong alloys for the aerospace industry.</li>
    </ul>
