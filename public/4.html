    <h2>Interesting Facts About Beryllium</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beryllium is lightweight but has a high melting point, making it useful in aerospace applications.</li>
        <li>It is nonmagnetic and has excellent thermal conductivity.</li>
        <li>Beryllium is transparent to X-rays and is used in the production of X-ray windows.</li>
        <li>It is primarily obtained from the minerals beryl and bertrandite.</li>
        <li>Due to its toxicity, handling beryllium requires strict safety precautions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Beryllium</h2>
    <p>Beryllium was discovered in 1798 by French chemist <strong>Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin</strong> while analyzing beryl and emeralds. It was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich WÃ¶hler and Antoine Bussy through the reduction of beryllium chloride.</p>
    
    <h2>Uses of Beryllium</h2>
    <p>Beryllium is valued for its unique properties and is used in various industries:</p>
