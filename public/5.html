    <h2>Interesting Facts About Boron</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boron is found in the Earth's crust mainly in the form of borates, such as borax and kernite.</li>
        <li>It is a poor conductor of electricity at room temperature but becomes a good conductor at higher temperatures.</li>
        <li>Boron compounds, like boric acid, are used as mild antiseptics and in glassmaking.</li>
        <li>Amorphous boron is a brown powder, while crystalline boron is extremely hard and black.</li>
        <li>Boron is essential for plants but toxic in high quantities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Boron</h2>
    <p>Boron was first isolated in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and Louis Jacques Th√©nard. Its name comes from the Arabic word "buraq" and the Persian word "burah," referring to borax, a naturally occurring mineral containing boron.</p>
    
    <h2>Uses of Boron</h2>
    <p>Boron has a variety of applications across different industries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Glass and ceramics:</strong> Boron is used to make borosilicate glass, which is heat resistant.</li>
        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Boron is an essential micronutrient in fertilizers for plant growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Detergents:</strong> Boron compounds like borax are used as cleaning agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Boron is used in semiconductors and as a dopant in silicon manufacturing.</li>
        <li><strong>Space exploration:</strong> Boron fibers are used to reinforce lightweight materials in aerospace technology.</li>
    </ul>
