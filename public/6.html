    <h1>Carbon </h1> <hr/>
    
    <p class="intro"><strong>Carbon</strong> is the sixth element in the periodic table and is classified as a nonmetal. It is one of the most versatile elements, forming the basis of all known life. Carbon is capable of forming a vast number of compounds due to its ability to form four bonds.</p>
