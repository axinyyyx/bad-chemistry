    <h1>Nitrogen </h1> <hr/>
    
    <p class="intro"><strong>Nitrogen</strong> is the seventh element in the periodic table and is classified as a nonmetal. It is a diatomic gas (N<sub>2</sub>) at room temperature and makes up about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Facts About Nitrogen</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nitrogen gas is colorless, odorless, and tasteless.</li>
        <li>It is essential for all living organisms as it is a key component of amino acids and nucleic acids.</li>
        <li>Nitrogen gas is relatively inert and does not easily react with other substances under normal conditions.</li>
        <li>Compounds like ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and nitrates are vital for agriculture and industry.</li>
        <li>Nitrogen is used in cryogenics due to its low boiling point (-196Â°C).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Nitrogen</h2>
    <p>Nitrogen was discovered in 1772 by Scottish chemist <strong>Daniel Rutherford</strong>. He demonstrated that a portion of air does not support combustion or life, which he called "noxious air." Later, it was named "nitrogen" from the Greek words "nitron" and "genes," meaning "saltpeter-forming."</p>
    
    <h2>Uses of Nitrogen</h2>
    <p>Nitrogen has various industrial, scientific, and agricultural applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Nitrogen compounds like ammonia and urea are critical for agricultural fertilizers.</li>
        <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Nitrogen gas is used to create an inert atmosphere for preserving food and sensitive materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryogenics:</strong> Liquid nitrogen is used for freezing biological specimens and in medical procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Explosives:</strong> Nitrogen is a key component in explosives like TNT and nitroglycerin.</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Nitrogen gas is used in metalworking and electronics manufacturing to prevent oxidation.</li>
    </ul>
